# Walmart Sales Analysis ðŸ“Š
Project Overview
This project analyzes Walmart sales data to identify key factors influencing sales performance across different stores. By evaluating variables such as holidays, economic factors (CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment rates), and store performance, the analysis offers insights into improving sales and operational efficiency.

Tools Used
Database: MySQL
Languages: SQL
Dataset: Walmart sales data including Weekly Sales, Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment Rate
Project Objectives
Identify high and low-performing stores based on weekly sales data.
Analyze the impact of holidays on sales performance.
Correlate economic factors such as CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment with sales trends.
Provide actionable recommendations to improve store performance.

Key Findings
Store Performance:

Store #20 is the highest-performing store with an average weekly sales of $2,107,676.
Store #33 is the lowest-performing store with an average weekly sales of $259,861.
There is a significant variance in sales across stores, with a total sales variance of $318,509,684,090.

Holiday Sales Boost:Sales during holidays are 7.84% higher than during working days, indicating the importance of seasonal and holiday promotions.
Correlation with Economic Factors:

Temperature: Weak negative correlation with sales (-0.0638)
Fuel Price: Very weak positive correlation with sales (0.0095)
CPI: Negative correlation (-0.0726)
Unemployment: Stronger negative correlation (-0.1062)

Day Type Sales:
Working Days: $1,041,256 average sales
Holidays: $1,122,887 average sales

Recommendations
Holiday Focus: Maximize promotions and inventory during holiday seasons, as sales are significantly higher.
Low-Performing Store Strategy: Implement targeted strategies for underperforming stores (e.g., Store #33), including local promotions and operational improvements.
Consistency Across Stores: Standardize successful practices from high-performing stores like #20 to reduce sales variance across all locations.
Monitor Economic Trends: Although the correlation between economic factors and sales is weak, unemployment rate shows the highest impact. Areas with higher unemployment might need targeted interventions.
